      <p>
        In short, A11Y means &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo;. A11Y is what is known
        as a numeronym, which is somewhat similar to an acronym. Unlike an
        acronym, numbers are used in place of letters to shorten the term. You
        may already be familiar with other numeronyms, such as &ldquo;K-9&rdquo;
        for &ldquo;Canine&rdquo; or &ldquo;W3C&rdquo; for &ldquo;World Wide Web
        Consortium&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a number of ways a numeronym can be created. In the case of
        translating &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; to &ldquo;A11Y&rdquo;, the first
        and last letters of &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; are preserved, replacing
        the remaining letters between with their sum total of 11.
